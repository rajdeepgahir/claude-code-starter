## Course modules

### [Module 1: From idea to shipped product](claude-code-in-practice/module-1/README.md)

You'll set up Claude Code, write a `CLAUDE.md` that gives Claude context about your project, install two skills, and ship something by the end.

Assignments:
1. Set up your `CLAUDE.md`
2. Install `/prd-generator` and `/user-story-writer`
3. Go from idea to PRD to MVP

Files:
- [claude-code-in-practice/module-1/README.md](claude-code-in-practice/module-1/README.md) - setup guide and assignments
- [claude-code-in-practice/module-1/CLAUDE.md](claude-code-in-practice/module-1/CLAUDE.md) - starter template
- [claude-code-in-practice/module-1/.claude/skills/](claude-code-in-practice/module-1/.claude/skills/prd-generator/SKILL.md)

## Built with Claude Code

Apps built live in class. Fork them, break them, learn from them.

| Repo | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| [word-humanizer](https://github.com/hamzafarooq/word-humanizer/) | Rewrites AI-generated text to sound human |
| [seo-writer](https://github.com/hamzafarooq/seo-writer) | Generates SEO-optimized blog content |

More get added as the course runs.

## What is Claude Code?

It's an AI assistant that runs inside your project folder and reads your actual files. The difference from Claude.ai or ChatGPT:

| Claude.ai / ChatGPT | Claude Code |
|---|---|
| You paste text into a chat box | Claude reads your actual files |
| Starts fresh every conversation | Remembers your project through `CLAUDE.md` |
| You copy-paste results manually | Edits files for you directly |
| General-purpose | Configured for how your team works |

---

## Installation

Open your terminal and run:
```
npm install -g @anthropic/claude-code
```

No `npm`? Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) (LTS version), then try again.

Check it worked:
```
claude --version
```

### API key setup

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Create an account, go to API Keys, create a key
3. Copy it (starts with `sk-ant-...`)

```
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
```

To make it stick across sessions:
```
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Don't commit this key to GitHub.

## Prompts worth keeping

| What you want | What to type |
|---|---|
| Generate a PRD | `/prd-generator` |
| Write user stories | `/user-story-writer` |
| Find gaps in a spec | `"Review docs/prd.md and tell me what's missing"` |
| Write for execs | `"Rewrite this as 3 bullets for a VP with 10 seconds"` |
| Prep for engineering | `"What questions will engineers ask about this PRD?"` |
| Build a sprint plan | `"Turn the must-have stories into a 2-week sprint plan"` |
| Stress-test a flow | `"What edge cases am I missing here?"` |

---

## Troubleshooting

**"command not found: claude"**
Run `npm install -g @anthropic/claude-code` again. Check Node.js is installed: `node --version`.

**API key error**
Run `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here`. Make sure you copied the full key including `sk-ant-`.

**Claude isn't reading my CLAUDE.md**
The file must be named exactly `CLAUDE.md` (all caps) in the folder where you ran `claude`.

**Skill not triggering**
Check that the path is `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and the `name:` in the frontmatter matches what you typed after `/`.
